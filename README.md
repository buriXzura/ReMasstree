## Phase 1: Initial Research and Baseline Analysis

### 1.1 MassTree and RECIPE Study

**MassTree Architecture Analysis:**
- Studied trie-like concatenation of B+-trees for variable-length key handling
- Analyzed internal and leaf node structures with 15-element width
- Investigated the $2^{64}$ fanout design for fast searches
- Examined prefix sharing mechanisms where keys with same 8h-byte prefix reside in layer h

**RECIPE Framework Understanding:**
- Analyzed conversion methodology from DRAM to PMEM indices
- Studied three categories of DRAM indices:
  - Updates via single atomic stores (flush + fence)
  - Writers fix inconsistencies (flush + fence)
  - Writers don't fix inconsistencies (detect + fix + flush + fence)
- Investigated 2-step atomic SMO (Structural Modification Operations)
- Identified limitations in RECIPE's new-layer persistence

### 1.2 Persistent Memory Characterization

**Performance Baseline Establishment:**
- Conducted extensive microbenchmarking of PMEM operations
- Analyzed read/write latencies across different granularities (8B to 32KB)
- Compared different persistence strategies:
  - `pmem_memcpy_persist` under various scenarios
  - `memcpy` + `pmem_persist` combinations  
  - Sequential vs random access patterns
- Established bandwidth and latency characteristics for aligned vs unaligned operations

**Key Findings:**
- Sequential writes achieve ~2GB/s at larger granularities
- Random writes show performance degradation with lock contention
- Aligned operations significantly outperform unaligned access
- Cache line granularity (64B) represents optimal unit for many operations

## Phase 2: Problem Identification and Algorithm Design

### 2.1 RECIPE Limitations Analysis

**Identified Critical Issues:**
1. **Non-atomic new layer addition:** RECIPE didn't make new layer creation persistent and fail-atomic
2. **Redistribution challenges:** Similar atomicity issues during node redistribution
3. **Incomplete concurrency model:** Gaps in handling concurrent operations during structural modifications

### 2.2 B-link Tree Enhancements

**Advanced Concurrency Control:**
- Implemented custom version-based locking using `VersionNumber` class
- Designed multi-level lock hierarchy:
  - Insert locks (4-bit version, 20-bit range)
  - SMO locks (20-bit version range)  
  - Lock version (20-bit global version)
- Added repair mechanism for crash recovery

**Rebalancing Algorithm:**
- Developed optional rebalancing for improved space utilization
- Implemented redistribution between sibling nodes
- Added support for both inner and leaf node rebalancing
- Designed persistent-safe rebalancing using permutation arrays

## Phase 3: ReMassTree Implementation

### 3.1 Core Architecture

**Node Structure Design:**
```cpp
class inner_node {
    inner_node *parent, *right, *left;          // 24B navigation
    std::atomic<uint64_t> typeVersionLockObsolete; // 8B version control
    uint64_t highest;                           // 8B key boundary
    permuter permutation;                       // 8B ordering
    void *child0;                               // 8B first child
    uint32_t level_;                            // 4B tree level
    kv entry[LEAF_WIDTH];                       // 240B key-value pairs
}; // Total: ~304B per node (optimized for single PMEM block)
```

**Dual-Level Locking System:**
The ReMassTree implements a sophisticated two-tier locking mechanism within each node's version number:

1. **Insert Lock (Simple Writes):** Fine-grained locking for standard key-value operations
   - 20-bit version counter for insert operations
   - Allows concurrent writes to different nodes
   - Lock-free reads with version validation
   - Minimal contention for point operations

2. **SMO Lock (Structural Modification Operations):** Coarse-grained locking for tree restructuring
   - Separate 20-bit version counter for structural changes
   - Coordinates splits, merges, and rebalancing operations
   - Ensures atomicity during node redistribution
   - Prevents concurrent structural modifications

**Version-Based Concurrency Control:**
```cpp
class VersionNumber {
    uint64_t v; // [lock_version:20][smo_version:20][insert_version:20][flags:4]
    
    bool repair_req() { 
        return (smoLock()||insertLock()) && (lockVersion()!=global_lock_version); 
    }
    uint insertVersion() { return (v & INSERT_VERSION) >> 4; }
    uint smoVersion() { return (v & SMO_VERSION) >> 24; }
};
```

**Concurrent Access Guarantees:**
- **Lock-Free Reads:** Multiple concurrent readers without blocking writers
- **Multi-Writer Support:** Concurrent writes to different nodes without interference  
- **Consistency Guarantees:** No inconsistent states visible to readers
- **Atomic Updates:** Version-controlled validation ensures read consistency
- **PMEM Optimization:** Node size designed for single persistent memory block alignment

**Advanced Features:**
- **Permutation-based ordering:** Efficient insert/delete without data movement
- **Version-controlled access:** Lock-free reads with consistency guarantees
- **Cache-line optimization:** Strategic layout for PMEM performance (304B ≈ 5 cache lines)
- **Atomic pointer management:** Safe concurrent navigation with CAS operations
- **Single-block alignment:** Node size optimized for PMEM block boundaries

### 3.2 Persistent Memory Integration

**PMEM Operations:**
- Custom `clflush`/`clwb` implementation for cache line flushing
- `movnt64` for non-temporal writes to PMEM
- Strategic placement of memory fences (`mfence`)
- Prefetching support for improved sequential access

**Crash Consistency:**
- Atomic updates using compare-and-swap operations
- Version-based validation for detecting incomplete operations
- Recovery mechanisms for post-crash repair
- Garbage collection hooks for orphaned memory

## Technical Innovations and Research Contributions

### 1. **Hierarchical Concurrency Control Architecture**
The ReMassTree introduces a novel two-tier locking system that addresses the fundamental challenge of concurrent access in persistent memory environments [1,2]:

```cpp
class VersionNumber {
    uint64_t v;  // [lock_version:20][smo_version:20][insert_version:20][flags:4]
    
    bool repair_req() { 
        return (smoLock()||insertLock()) && (lockVersion()!=global_lock_version); 
    }
    
    // Dual-lock acquisition for different operation types
    uint64_t tryInsertLock() { return __sync_fetch_and_or(&v, INSERT_LOCK); }
    uint64_t trySMOLock() { return __sync_fetch_and_or(&v, BOTH_LOCKS); }
};
```
